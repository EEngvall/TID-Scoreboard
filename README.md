# TID-Scoreboard

This is a very simple project for a workplace event.  The customer service department was split into teams and tasked with using canned goods and other non perishables to construct a sports themed display.  Our group chose to build a stadium using the mentioned supplies.  I thought it would be cool to add a digital scoreboard to show some work spirit and give the whole project some flai.  The scoreboard uses two 128x64 OLED screens for the "Home" and "Away" scores as well as a single 128x32 OLED screen for the game clock. All three screens were programmed using C++ and an esp32 microcontroller. The scoreboard utilizes 3 buttons on top to control the incrementing of the scores, one button for each team, as well as an additional button used to reset the scores and put the scoreboard into demo mode.  While in demo mode the scores will randomly increment at a set interval as well as show the touchdown animation (this same animation is displayed when the teams score button is pressed also).  To reset the scores the center button needs to be pressed and held for at least 3 seconds.  The projects also features a small colored lithophane on top with the TID logo (Turlock Irrigation District) illuminated by a small series of 5v LEDs. All of these items are ran off a single 5v USB power bank located in the base of the scoreboard.  ![6321449f-06c0-4821-a378-33ec6391c7c9](https://github.com/EEngvall/TID-Scoreboard/assets/45218590/3f667518-93a4-4c0c-a141-6b5b465a6928)
